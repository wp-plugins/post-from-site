TODO:

Translate JS? How?
Add shortcode [http://codex.wordpress.org/Shortcode_API] to allow pfs to be included on a page
Make a widget? Would this be popular?
Integrate with WP Gallery somehow - spent a while on this last summer and didn't get it to succeed. Look at Leah's recced FTP gallery plugin.
Buddypress?
Multi-site 3.0?
